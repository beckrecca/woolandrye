          <p>Wool & Rye started in 2013 when Christina Doris realized she needed something to do 
          with her hands besides scratching her butt. She produces quality items using only the finest
           wool from Finnish Goldbull sheep who feed on a strict diet of mashed corn, buttercup stems, 
           and boiled sweet potatoes. Her favorite knitting techniques are the wild mountain man square
            dance and the crossing guard's grudge. Factory Knitbots, who produce the majority of 
            big business knitwear, are incapable of both techniques, only cranking out the boring
             and unstable Maloney's baloney. In addition, factory Knitbots are cruelly treated and
            underpaid.</p>

		  <p>Each year over 10,000 babies die because their cheap sweaters disintegrate. 
		  Wool & Rye is dedicated to keeping babies and older humans warm throughout the 
		  day and even at night. </p>

		  <p>The hand-spun yarn from Wool & Rye is hypoallergenic and gluten free, 
		  unlike mass-produced yarns. Yarn factories are the reason that bees are dying. 
		  Wool & Rye's yarn-spinning process is careful, gentle, and thorough. First, 
		  the freshest wool is treated by hand with the death comb. Then, it is twisted 
		  around the twistamajic with care. Finally, the wheely-do works its magic, and we
		  have beautiful Wool & Rye yarn. </p>
