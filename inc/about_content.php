            In 2013, Christina Doris realized she needed something to do with her hands 
            besides bake breads and cakes and Wool & Rye was born. She produces quality 
            items using only the finest wools and wool blends sourced from independent 
            dyers and local mills. Each item is hand knit with great care and attention to detail. 
          </p>
          Wool & Rye is dedicated to using premium quality fibres and yarns to produce hand-knit 
          wear and hand-spun yarns. The fibres used to produce our hand-spun yarn are sourced from 
          local farms and mills as often as possible. Wool & Rye both hand dyes their yarns and 
          fibres and also supports independent hand dyers of the fibre community.

            The hand-spun yarn from Wool & Rye is made on Christina's Ashford Kiwi 2 
            spinning wheel and occasionally on a drop spindle. Our natural fleece is hand
             washed and combed or carded by Christina before being transformed into yarn 
             then knit-wear. Christina takes great pride in using raw materials from local, 
             independent and small farms and fibre artists.
