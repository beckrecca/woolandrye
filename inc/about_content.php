            Wool & Rye started in 2013 when Christina Doris realized she needed something to do 
          with her hands. Hand-knitting is better for wearer and maker alike.
          For the wearer, the handknit garment is more original and softer than any
          commercial garment.
          For the maker, the act is meditative and soothing.
          When you purchase a sweater from Wool & Rye, you are purchasing a little piece of love.

            Commercial yarn is produced by machines that stretch it much more tightly
            than the hand-spinner would. The yarn loses its spring, its vivacity. 
            While these machines spit out identical pieces of yarn, each skein of
            handspun is unique. The texture of handspun yarn varies as much as people do.
